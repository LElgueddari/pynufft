Introduction
============

**Purpose**

The pynufft user manual documents *Python non-uniform fast Fourier transform*, a Python program for non-uniform fast Fourier transform.

Pynufft reimplements the MATLAB version of min-max NUFFT_, with the following features:  

.. _NUFFT: http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~fessler/irt/irt/nufft/

- Written in pure Python.

- Based on numerical libraries, such as Numpy, Scipy (matplotlib for displaying examples).

- Provides the python interface including forward transform, adjoint transform and other routines.

- Provides 1D/2D/3D examples for further developments.

- New in version 3.2.9 (Experimental) Supporting NUFFT on the NVIDIA's graphic processing unit (GPU). It requires scikit-cuda and python-cuda-cffi.

Users of pynufft should be familiar with discrete Fourier transform (DFT). More information can be found in the paper:

*Fessler JA, Sutton BP. Nonuniform fast Fourier transforms using min-max interpolation. IEEE Trans Signal Process 2003;51(2):560-574.*

which details the min-max interpolator for NUFFT.
